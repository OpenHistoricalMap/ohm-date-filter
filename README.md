Input a start date and/or an end date and press on the button `set`. Now you can move the slider to filter everything on the map. Pay attention if the visible way or point is connected to something else below - you can mess up the filtered data as well. 

## Supported tags
To see what tags in `start_date=*` and `end_date=*` are currently supported, please look in the isseue [Support for approximations in start_date=*? Progress-tracking](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/ohm-date-filter/issues/8).
